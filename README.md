# DataFormatConverterViewer
Convert between data formats and view them nicely.

This is an AI driven project.

This project was inspired out of rage and fury when I kept needing to convert a bunch of Base64URL strings to ArrayBuffer. Then needing to visualise the byte array as an array of decimals.
Maybe I'm just bad at Googling but I couldn't find a tool to do this, so I asked my good friend, AI, to build a tool for me. Et Voila!
